My name is James, James Bond. I am working in a coveted mission in a far away land. My mission is very risky, so I am writing this note just in case I lost my life. In the case that my coworker finds this message, it will help them continue this mission. However, if you are not my coworker and happen to decrypt this message, please forward this to Mr. John Snow. You can contact him by using a URL that I will include in the second part of this encrypted message.

IF YOU ARE NOT MY COWORKER AND HAVE ENOUGH SKILLS TO DECRYPT THIS MESSAGE, I SALUTE YOU. IN THIS PART, I WILL TELL YOU THE URL TO CONTACT MR. JOHN SNOW AT THE END OF THIS MESSAGE. YOU NEED TO ACCESS THE URL AND POST THE THIRD PART OF THIS ENCRYPTED MESSAGE, WHICH CONTAINS THE SECRET THAT I FOUND DURING MY MISSION. AS TO WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN MY COWORKER, I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE A HANDSOME REWARD IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY SEND JOHN THE SECRET OF MY MISSION. UNLESS, YOU ARE MY ENEMY WHO FINDS AND ENCRYPTS THIS MESSAGE. IN ANY CASE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT SECRET THAT I FOUND BECAUSE THE THIRD PART OF THIS ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IS MUCH MORE CHALLENGING THAN THE PREVIOUS ONES. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

THE MAD SCIENTIST, DR. PHAKPOOM CHINPRUTTHIWONG, HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A TIME-MACHINE. SUPPOSEDLY, HE USED THE TIME-MACHINE TO ALTER THE PREVIOUS TIMELINE WHERE I SHOULD HAVE SUCCESSFULLY STEAL THE TIME-MACHINE TECHNOLOGY. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I OVERHEARD HIM DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH HIS COLLEGUE VIA THE LISTENING DEVICES THAT I INSTALLED EVERYWHERE IN HIS LAB. HOW CLUMSY OF HIM TO NOT NOTICE SUCH THINGS WHEN HE CAN DEVELOP A TIME-MACHINE. IN ANY CASE, TO PREVENT HIM FROM USING THE TIME-MACHINE TO ALTER THE REALITY, YOU MUST NOT LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU KNOW HE COMPLETED THE TIME-MACHINE. THEN, YOU MUST WIPE HIM CLEAN BEFORE HE IS ALERT. TO ACCESS HIS LABORATORY, YOU NEED AN ID CARD AND A PASSWORD. THE ID CARD CAN BE FOUND IN MY SECRET LOCKER AT THE DESIGNATED PLACE. THE PASSWORD IS 297381. GOOD LUCK PREVENTING THE MAD SCIENTIST FROM DESTROYING THIS WORLD'S BALANCE.
